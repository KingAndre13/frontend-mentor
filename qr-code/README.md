### My process and What I learned
  Well, I think what I learned from the project is that no matter how simple it may be, it taught me to be confident. I came here to practice what I learned in the courses I take and this challenge showed me that I am capable of building beautiful designs like the one in this project. I started out a little lost at the beginning, but I managed to develop what I wanted.

### Continued development
   I want to develop better in web layouts.
